**Module2**

Hit a lot of issues with git bash push,and deploy a cloned repo on github,

so I just finish my work first,then upload my work at once.

With experience from last module,the header part is easy to finish,add navigation,

styling and adjust some detail.

Watched some sample,picked gallery as my main work class,used 2\*2 space for first application,
<a><img></a> to use a photo as a link.use relative as position for main work class.

Finished footer class,did a lot of adjustion,still a lot of space on the right part,
Use the aside class from last module,changed some content.

and final adjustion.:)
